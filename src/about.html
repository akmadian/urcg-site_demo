                                            Equity in physics has always been in my mind seeing how 
                                            my female students and students of color are the ones 
                                            who typically struggled and were also the ones who disengaged 
                                            first and claim that they weren't "physics persons." 
                                            I read about Moses' curriculum and reached out to him 
                                            wanting to learn more about what I'm seeing (why there 
                                            are underrepresented people of color in physics) and 
                                            how I can address that in the classroom. A few years 
                                            later, I'm still implementing the curriculum albeit 
                                            in different but more cohesive ways!
