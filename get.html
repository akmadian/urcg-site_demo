                <h3>What is This?</h3>
                <p>
                    This curriculum grew out of one teacher’s idea: what if we could use the tools of science to examine the culture 
                    of science itself through the lens of equity and inclusion?  And what if we brought students into that process? 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thirteen years later, other teachers have picked up on his work and started putting their own spin on the 
                    curriculum. The resource you’re looking at now is a product of that collaboration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since different teachers have different needs, time and interests, the curriculum is designed so that 
                    <b>you can easily choose the parts that will work for you</b> and <b>modify them to suit your needs.</b>

                    these fields have a unique opportunity and responsibility to address this.  
                    The attached curriculum offers those teachers a flexible, easily modifiable 
                    set of lessons with which to do so.

                    Scientists have long recognized that their ranks do not match the broader 
                    population; specifically, science in America is skewed more male and more 
                    white than the country as a whole.  Numerous explanations have been offered 
                    to explain this disconnect and, while research has discredited the possible 
                    explanation of a lack of aptitude in underrepresented groups
                    <a href="#ref-1" id="uref-1"><sup>[i]</sup></a>
                    , the problem remains complex and enormously consequential.

                <p style="margin-bottom: 0rem; margin-top: .4rem">
                    &bull; A lack of diversity in portrayals of science contributes to a lack of 
                    diversity in the students who pursue the field; as the saying goes 
                    “you cannot be what you cannot see.”. Research has shown that diverse 
                    groups do more impactful scientific work
                    <a href="#ref-2" id="uref-2"><sup>[ii]</sup></a>; 
                    science indirectly suffers 
                    as a result of this limited diversity.  Our charge, in the words of the 
                    American Association of Physics Teachers, is “making [science] more 
                    inclusive and supportive of women and people of color is required for 
                    doing excellent[science].

                    &bull; The equitable access to science for all is, in the powerful words of 
                    Chanda Prescod-Weinstein, a matter of “fundamental human decency.” 
                    The current reality, in which this access is not fully realized, is 
                    a moral problem as much as a pragmatic one.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0rem">
                    &bull; In both society and science, the ability to recognize and work in 
                    diverse settings is increasingly valuable. By talking about diversity 
                    (or the lack thereof) as it pertains to science, we will be better 
                    preparing our students for their lives as scientists or as engaged citizens.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem">
                    &bull; When students are implicitly taught that science can only be done by 
                    a select few, science may be inadvertently portrayed as inaccessible 
                    or even irrelevant to “normal” people or people who love the arts. A 
                    population that regards science as outside their reference is unlikely 
                    to fund it and may even come to fear its power.

                    This underrepresentation is a problem for science teachers to help solve 
                    and, happily, we have effective ways to do so.  One such way is to engage 
                    students in conversation about this underrepresentation, and to explore 
                    the societal forces that it reflects. In doing so, students will be using 
                    and practicing scientific skills, while gaining a deeper understanding of 
                    “science as a human endeavor”
                    <a href="#ref-4" id="uref-4"><sup>[iv]</sup></a>. 
                    Additionally, learning about underrepresentation has been shown to 
                    deepen the formation of scientific identity, belief in the value of 
                    science, and science self-efficacy in students from underrepresented groups
                    <a href="#ref-5" id="uref-5"><sup>[v]</sup></a>,
                    <a href="#ref-6" id="uref-6"><sup>[vi]</sup></a>, 
                    and learning about affective factors which keep students out of 
                    science has been shown to reduce their effect on those students
                    <a href="#ref-7" id="uref-7"><sup>[vii]</sup></a>,

                    Learning about underrepresentation is both an important part of 
                    scientific learning for our students and a powerful solution to 
                    the challenges listed above.

                    By creating this resource, we hope to help science teachers facilitate 
                    these important conversations about who does science and why. We have 
                    undertaken this project because we love science and want it to be better, 
                    because we believe all students can learn and deserve to fall in love with 
                    science if they choose, and because we recognize that the history of science 
                    teaching and culture of science have ignored many students and misled 
                    nearly all. Considering the demographics of who does science is not only 
                    relevant but, more importantly, represents our recognition that science is, 
                    by its very nature, a human endeavor.

                    After years of doing this work with students, we have seen its transformative 
                    potential in our own classrooms and beyond, and heard it from our students:
                </p>

                            [Race] does relate to what we learn. By discussing it in physics, we are 
                            able to connect what we have learned to other things in ‘real life.’ By 
                            learning about it, I feel less discouraged from perhaps pursuing a course 
                            in math or science.
                        </p>

                <p>
                    These conversations are not only for the benefit of students from 
                    underrepresented demographic groups. Students who identify in the majority 
                    will benefit as well.  Being able to work in diverse groups and participate 
                    comfortably in conversations about society and representation is an important 
                    skill for graduating students, according to employer surveys.

                    Scholars generally agree that the problem with under-representation of 
                    specific groups in science stems not from any characteristic of these individuals, 
                    but rather from the culture of science itself
                    <a href="#ref-9" id="uref-9"><sup>[ix]</sup></a>. 
                    Given this origin, any solution to rectifying the lack of diversity in 
                    science must find a way to change the culture of science to be more 
                    welcoming and inclusive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is our fervent hope and assertion that this can happen in part through 
                    education, not by changing the mindset of individuals who might be categorized 
                    into one or more of these under-represented groups or by helping them achieve 
                    particular experiences to better prepare them for careers in science, but 
                    rather by effecting a change in those students who DO belong to the dominant 
                    paradigm of who does physics. Yes, change is hard, but scientists solve hard 
                    problems all the time.  Our goal, in simple terms, is to equip the next 
                    generation of scientists with a broader sense of who should do physics so that 
                    they can challenge and, thereby change, the culture of the field.

                    At the most fundamental level, the actual population of scientists is more diverse 
                    than most common portrayals suggest it to be. For reasons of accuracy alone, science 
                    teachers should share an appropriately diverse group of scientists to their students. 
                    When this is not feasible due to geographical isolation, teachers need ways to expose 
                    their students to this diversity since they might not see it firsthand.

                    As secondary teachers, we are in a unique position to influence our students
                    <a href="#ref-10" id="uref-10"><sup>[x]</sup></a>
                    and, by extension, society.  Though many of us were not trained to bring conversations 
                    about representation and equity and society into our classroom, we recognize that 
                    by not doing so, we suggest that these things do not matter in science.  In the 
                    words of Na’ilah Suad Nasir, “To not discuss or address issues of race, culture, 
                    and inequality is to accept the current patterns of inequality and marginalization.” 
                    <a href="#ref-11" id="uref-11"><sup>[xi]</sup></a>
                    Moreover, our students are living in a world in which these topics are discussed 
                    more and more widely; bringing the conversation into the science classroom is a 
                    matter of continuation, not insertion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our students will exist in society, as scientists or otherwise, and this unit 
                    offers a way to better prepare them both for a life in the lab (so to speak) 
                    and a life in society.  We hope these resources prove useful to our science 
                    teaching peers, and that with your help, this work will continue to expand and evolve.

The goal is to increase the representation of women amongst physics bachelor’s degrees and begin to shift deep-seated cultural views about who does physics.

                                If half of the high school physics teachers encourage just one more female student to pursue physics as a major, a historic shift will be initiated — female students will make up 50% of incoming physics majors.

                                Our mission is to help teachers and schools educate children and youth to be active participants in a diverse democracy...
                                
                                Our program emphasizes social justice and anti-bias. The anti-bias approach encourages children and young people to challenge prejudice and learn how to be agents of change in their own lives. Our Social Justice Standards show how anti-bias education works through the four domains of identity, diversity, justice and action.
